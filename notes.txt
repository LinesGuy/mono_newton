get corners of screen, convert screen to world coords

input equation
get solutions (maybe solve? or input solutions to calculate equation)

for each coordinate, apply newton formula, compare destination to all solutions, get nearest, colour pixel based in which solution

equation is a list of vectors, the X part is the coefficient, the Y part is the power
if f(x) = a*x^b, f'(x) = b*a*x^(b-1)

newton raphson method: x = x - f(x / f'(x)
